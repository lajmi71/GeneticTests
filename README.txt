There are two seperate directories: 1.Heritability and 2.Parent-of-origin.

The R code for the heritability test is in the directory 1.Heritability. You need to run the Appli.1.R file to run an example of the heritability test.

the R code for the Parent-of-origin test is the directory 2.Parent-of-origin. You need to run the Appli.2.R file to run an example of the Parent-of-origin test.
